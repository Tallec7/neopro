## Description

* fix(deploy): force rejectUnauthorized: false for cloud database SSL
Remove the environment variable override to ensure rejectUnauthorized is
always false when DATABASE_SSL_CA is not provided. This is required for
cloud providers like Render whose certificates may not be in the system
CA store.

* fix(deploy): add NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED fallback for SSL issues
The pg library's ssl.rejectUnauthorized option may not be sufficient for
some cloud providers. Added NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 as a fallback
and improved logging to show the actual SSL config being used.
