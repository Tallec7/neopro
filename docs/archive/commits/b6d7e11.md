**Commit:** `b6d7e114da02a6235fc8a6f0f67c4fb5ad2c6ca1`
**Date:** 2025-12-05
**Auteur:** Tallec7
**Type:** fix

## Description

Reorganize CORS middleware to ensure headers are always set before
responding to OPTIONS requests. This fixes the issue where the admin
interface (https://neopro-admin.kalonpartners.bzh) was blocked by CORS
policy during preflight requests.
Changes:
- Extract origin resolution logic for clarity
- Always set CORS headers before handling OPTIONS requests
- Ensure Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set for all authorized origins
