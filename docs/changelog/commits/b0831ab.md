* feat(deployment): implement video deployment to sites
Add deployment service that:
- Starts deployment when created via API
- Sends deploy_video command to connected sites via WebSocket
- Updates deployment progress and status based on site responses
- Handles failed deployments when no sites are connected
Also improve socket service to handle deployment progress events
with proper status updates (in_progress, completed, failed).

* feat(deployment): keep deployments pending until sites connect
- Deployments now stay in 'pending' status when target sites are offline
- When a site connects, pending deployments are automatically processed
- Uses lazy import to avoid circular dependencies between services
This allows pushing videos to sites that will receive them when they
come online, rather than failing immediately.
