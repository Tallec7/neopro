* fix: make raspberry installation self-contained
- Add server files directly in raspberry/server/ directory
- Update install.sh to use ./server instead of ../server-render
- This allows the raspberry/ directory to be copied standalone
  without requiring the entire project structure

* docs: add server synchronization workflow
- Add sync-server.sh script to sync server-render/ to raspberry/server/
- Add README in raspberry/server/ explaining not to edit directly
- Update server-render/README.md with sync instructions
- Establishes server-render/ as source of truth
This prevents duplication issues when modifying server code.
