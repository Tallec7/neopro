## Description

* fix(analytics): bridge Angular app to sync-agent for analytics transmission
The Angular app was writing analytics to browser localStorage while the
sync-agent was reading from a JSON file - there was no connection between
the two, causing analytics to never reach Central server.
Added HTTP endpoint in local server to receive analytics from Angular app
and write them to the file that sync-agent reads from.

* fix(dashboard): handle undefined values in analytics component
Added null checks with || 0 fallback for numeric values before calling
toFixed() to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors when
analytics data is empty or incomplete.
